I am currently learning R and other things that go along with that, such as data wrangling and analysis, using r markdown to create notes and documents, blogdown to create this website, shiny, ggplot2, etc. I will demonstrate some of my skills in the projects section of this website.

I am currently studying for a B. Science with a major in statistics at University of Southern Queensland, Australia.

My other interests include bushwalking, playing chess, and drawing/animating.

Please contact me if you think I may be suitable for any job you have on offer, or if you wish to comment on anything of interest you see on this website.
