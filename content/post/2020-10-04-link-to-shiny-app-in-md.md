Ok, could not get Rmd to work. Going to try again in md format.

Nothing I tried would get the link to open in a new tab automatically. No worries.

Right click on the following link and "Open Link in New Tab".

[my test Shiny app](https://mikejhudson.shinyapps.io/Mike_4Reactivity_23BYO/ "Test Shiny")

Let's see how this goes. There is a blank line before and after the link.
