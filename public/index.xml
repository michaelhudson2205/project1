      <description>My third post. This one down in md format not Rmd. Seems that when I use R Markdown an html file is built and placed in the content/blog folder but not when md is used.</description>

      <description>I am currently learning R and other things that go along with that, such as data wrangling and analysis, using r markdown to create notes and documents, blogdown to create this website, shiny, ggplot2, etc. I will demonstrate some of my skills in the projects section of this website.
I am currently studying for a B. Science with a major in statistics at University of Southern Queensland, Australia.
My other interests include bushwalking, playing chess, and drawing/animating.</description>
